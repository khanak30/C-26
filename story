Hi. I’m Dino, the family dog. I help keep people safe, especially on the roads. 
Take a look at my diary to see what I did last week.
Sunday Some children really don’t think. Our neighbour’s boy ran in front of a car to get his ball. 
The car almost hit him.
 I saved him though. Remember, always look and listen.
